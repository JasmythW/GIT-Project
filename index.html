            In the ever-evolving world of web development, proficiency in version control is not just a skillâ€”it's an
            essential tool of the
            trade. This project will not only deepen your understanding of Git but also challenge you to document your
            learning journey.
            You will create a micro-site, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optionally), to showcase what you've learned
            about Git. This site
            itself will be a practical example of your skills, as you manage its development as a project on GitHub. From
            your initial research
            to the final deployment on GitHub Pages, every aspect of this project will reflect your mastery of Git in a
            real-world application.
            Embrace this opportunity to illustrate your journey, skills, and creativity, setting you on the path to becoming
            a proficient and
            versatile web developer.
